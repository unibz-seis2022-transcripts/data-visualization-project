Learnings from Marzahn-S端d:
  - 4 most expensive listings highly distort the data set with a significantly higher price than the rest, despite not having any reviews
  - 4 out of 5 out of the remaining most expensive listings are serviced apartments and offered by the same host
  - the more people accommodated the higher the price

```{r}
print_info_for_expensive_neighbourhoods(listings_marzahn_nord)
```

Learnings from Marzahn-Nord:
  - Only few listings
  - most expensive listing can be considered as outlier, since it does not have any reviews and is significantly more expensive than the other listings of the same neighbourhood

```{r}
marzahn_nord_only_with_reviews <- listings_marzahn_nord %>%

```


Learnings from Haselhorst:
  - It only has a small number of listings
  - 70% of the listings are boats or houseboats
  - 50% of the listings belong to the same host and have an equal price
  - The most expensive listing does not have any reviews
